Here are the original ideas of the craftsmanhip pyramid, just for the reference.

> Most people get hooked when they first stumble upon some form of **imperative programming**. I know I felt really proud to see that the computer does what it's told to, and that made my curiosity grow stronger. "What else can it do?" Then slowly started to learn the tools of the trade.

> The **object-oriented programming step** is a mind changer, it requires dedication and perseverance. Classes that are explained in tutorials / books / courses are very simple, and the apprentice feels overwhelmed when trying to apply that into real life projects. You can easily recognise this level by the presence of the Util/ folder or, worse, Util.php. Another symptom is that most classes are simple collection of functions, and do not describe a real behaviour. We've all been there at some point, and code we produce at this stage is usually referred to as the one that we are ashamed of later.

> Once the classes are in place, the need to organise them arises. This is the **modular structure** step, when we start learning about packages, and all of a sudden we feel the urge of refactoring, moving things around so that they make more sense when grouped together. The notion of MVC is appearing, and the design patterns door opens up.

> Then reality strikes. **Performance concerns** need to be addressed. We start learning about database optimisations, caching, logs, metrics, and it feels like being Cristopher Columbus discovering the New World. All these were right in front of us, yet we did not see.

> Of course bugs happen all the time, and now that the system is stable from a performance point of view, we start searching for ways to prevent problems from occurring. It is a time when we give **test-driven development** a chance. Everybody advertises it to save hours of good sleep, so we take a full dive.

> Trying to scale horizontally an application we then start **talking about services**. Exposing small pieces of functionality that can be accessed from multiple places / devices sounds like the right thing to do. Service containers, REST, and a lot of other acronyms become mother tongue to us.

> The next shift in mindset is **domain-driven design**. A hard nut to crack, I tell you. But so rewarding!
