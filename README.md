# Path to Craftshmanship

Ideas on getting to be a software craftsman. Practical lessons.

# General Principles

Generations
-----------

Writing this guide is done in "generations". They will not necessarily be
followed in order, sequentially, but intermingled, sometimes even like nested
loops.

First generation:

First write this documentation just as a "meta-guide", with the finished
structure (parts / chapters / sections) and short abstracts for each. Once
done, this documentation can already be used by a potential reader for guiding
his own independent research / learning process.

Second generation:

Each section is written by different authors in "mini feedback loops",
peer-reviewed on their own

Third generation:

Being written by different authors, the wording will differ. In order to
counteract this, one designated person will go through all parts / chapters
/ sections and rephrase them without changing the meaning of the text.

Fourth generation:

Reader's feedback and integration into the guide / book.


Writing Principles
------------------

The following are principles aimed at harmonizing the documentation which is
yet to be written.

- always use the right terminology
- understand how something works under the hood, but go at most 1 level deeper
  at a time
  For instance: when you learn a server-side web scripting language (Application
  Layer), you need to understand HTML first.
  When learning HTML, you need to understand HTTP first.


# Structure of Each Chapter / Section

Each chapter or section (henceforth called generally *unit of writing*, abv.
UOW) must have a certain structure.

- chapters start with an abstract
- UOW start with an estimated time-to-finish
- some UOWs start with a motivation (answering the question *why learning
  this is important?*)
- some UOWs have a subdivision *Common Pitfalls* which contains exclusively
  misunderstandings commonly observed among readers
- some UOWs have a subdivision *Frequent Questions* which contains exclusively
  questions which have been asked more than twice by readers
- exercises: ???
- each chapter ends with a *Summary*
